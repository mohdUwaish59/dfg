    <ul>
    <li>In each period, firms set a price <b>(0-100 ECU)</b> for the sale of goods to six consumers.</li>
    <li>The firm that sets the lowest price sets the market price and serves all consumers.<br>
        The profit is: <b>market price</b>&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;<b>number of consumers</b> served.</li>
    <li>The other firms that have chosen a higher price do not make any money.</li>
    <li>If more than one firm set the lowest price, they divide the consumers among themselves.</li>
    <li>The <b>consumers</b> are <b>other participants</b> of the experiment. In every period, they each receive an endowment of 100&nbsp;ECU and have to buy one good at the market price.<br>
        Thus, setting <b>higher market prices</b> lowers the <b>payoffs</b> of the <b>consumers</b>. 
    <li>After each period, firms learn the price choices and profits of all firms, and consumer expenditures.</li>
    <li>The <b>experiment consists of at least 20 periods.</b> After period 20, the outcome of a virtual 6-sided dice decides about the termination of the experiment. The experiment will only continue, if the dice roll was not a 6.
