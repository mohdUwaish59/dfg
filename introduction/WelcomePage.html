    <p>
    This HIT is an academic experiment on economic decision-making. Completing the entire experiment should not take more than a few minutes. The reward for participation is £1. A large share will be paid as a bonus payment, which depends on your decisions. Participation is voluntary; withdrawal forfeits payment. To avoid waiting times during the experiment, we will pay the bonuses in a few days once everybody has completed the experiment.
